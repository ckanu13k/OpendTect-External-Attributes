# Dip and Azimuth External Attribute Scripts
This a collection of [External Attribute](http://waynegm.github.io/OpendTect-Plugin-Docs/Attributes/ExternalAttrib/) scripts estimate orientation, ie dip or dip azimuth.

| PLUGIN | DESCRIPTION |
|--------|-------------|
| ex_vf_gradient3_dip.py | Orientation using the vector filtered gradient with derivatives by Kroon's 3 point operator |
| ex_gradient3_st_dip.py | Orientation using the gradient structure tensor with derivatives by Kroon's 3 point operator|
| ex_gradient5_st_dip.py | Orientation using the gradient structure tensor with derivatives by Farid's 5 point operator|
| ex_vf_phase3_dip.py | Orientation using the vector filtered phase gradient with derivatives by Kroon's 3 point operator |
| ex_phase3_st_dip.py | Orientation using the envelope weighted phase structure tensor with derivatives by Kroon's 3 point operator |
